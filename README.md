### The cheap_boi is going to be a new custom mechanical keyboard with a low pricetag
## TL;DR
- WIP, PCB has **NOT** been tested up to now 
- cheap, ortholinear keyboard with  OLED-Display and RGB underglow
- Gerbers added, print on own risk

## Features
### implemented
- microcontroller ATmega32u4
- ortholinear layout similar to the planck
- 4 individual function keys 
- underglow LEDs using WS2812B
- OLED display using SSD1306
- FR4 Bottom- and Switchplate with windows to see microcontroller and OLED
- have a look at the folder "renders" to see renders of the PCB and plates 
### planned
- support QMK-Firmware
- add acrylic viewing window to design (needs change to PCB)
- ESD-protection for USB-Port
- acrylic Bottom- and Switchplate
- other footprints for switches
- different mounting system 
- 3D-printed case
- renders of how the keyboard will look
### current status concerning prototype
- PCBs and parts are ordered, waiting for them to ship
